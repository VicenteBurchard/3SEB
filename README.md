# summary

This project contains experimental Python code for Three Source Energy Balance models using a single Priestley-Taylor (ThreeSEB_PL_singlePT) or double overstory and understory Priestley-Taylor (ThreeSEB_PL_doublePT) for estimating sensible and latent heat flux (evapotranspiration) based on measurements of radiometric surface temperature over tree-grass ecosystems.
